        <p>Hi! My name is Casey. I&apos;m the creator of this website! 
            Take a look around and check out some of my projects. As a solo developer I&apos;ve had to hone in on a lot of different, and unique, skills.
            Many of these skills result in little one-off projects with no end to them. I&apos;m in the process of uploading many of these projects to my github, if you check it out you can even see the code for this website!
            My biggest project to date is Nameless. It&apos;s the culmination of all my years of dedicated learning, and by far the most prominent project on this website. I&apos;ll be uploading alpha builds here as they&apos;re ready for release.
            Check back soon for my youtube detailing the entire project. Outside of programming, I have a love for art. I&apos;m an aspiring 3D artist and am just getting into digital painting and drawing.
            Use the &apos;Contact Me&apos; section above if you need to reach out. If you&apos;re looking for the latest build of Nameless, head on over to the &apos;Games&apos; section. If the &apos;Games&apos; section is empty, reach out using the &apos;Contact Me&apos; section!
